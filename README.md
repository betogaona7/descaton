# Penalty Fee Box
This project was developed in the [HackMty 2016](https://hackmty2016.devpost.com) with the idea to prevent people without disabilities occupying positions assigned to people with disabilities.

## Problem 
In many parts of Mexico there are unconscious drivers who continue to occupy spaces for the disabled. People don't understand and the problem is exacerbated in parking lots where government offices of all levels are located.

The problem is worrisome, because the more signs there are, the drivers still do not respect.

## Solution 
As a solution we proposed to modify the special plates that the vehicles have to identify people with disabilities, adding a NFS decal. In addition, each parking space dedicated to the disabled would be equipped with an NFS reader, which, upon obtaining the information on the plaque, will verify whether it is disabled or not, in case it is not so, it will send an alert to the official in charge.

## Code
The code was made using a basic arduino and a reading module NFC PN532. Obtain the information of a programmable NFC stamp and verify it using a MySQL database.
